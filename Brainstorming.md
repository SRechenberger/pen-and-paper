# Brainstorming

## Ideas

### Classless System
There is no benefit of a priori classes as in *Pathfinder* or *Dungeons and Dragons*.
In fact it only generates more bureaucracy and encumbers the role playing.

E.g.: there is no rational reason, why a warrior should be unable to learn at least simlple heal spells,
or a magician should be unable to use a sword effectively (see Gandalf in J.R.R. Tolkiens *The Lord of the Rings*).
Although *D&D* supports the widening of classes, this only proves a class system unnecessary.

### Focus on Basic Character Values
The should be as few *idirect* characters stats as possible;
i.e., no additional values, which are calculated from the characters base values,
such as *attack power* which may be calculated from *streng* or *agility*.

This removes the necessity of propagating changes through the character sheet.

### More Basic Character Values
To prevent the loss of depth, there could be more basic character values.
This could be achieved by *splitting* some values such as *Body* into
more distinct ones such as *Strenght*, *Reaction*, *Accuracy*, ...,
instead of calculating the disticter ones from the more basic ones.

### Levelless System
Instead of leveling a character as in any *D&D* like system,
not the character, but the character values itself could gain EP and levels,
as it is done in *The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion*.
Thus, a successful roll on a value could always yield some EP.

### Combined Check Rolls
Check rolls could be combined by adding all values together and rolling on the average of them:
e.g.: if someone wants to tell a lie, the values of *intelligence* and *charisma* are added and then divided by two;
then one has to roll below this value to succeed.

### Reversed Exponential Propotionality between a Basic Value and the Roll Value
To get the value for check rolls from a basic value,
a reversed exponential function could be used.
Such a function grows fast in the lower part of its domain and slows down the higher the input values get,
finally converging to a fixed value.

Given a basic roll success propability of 1/10, thus succeeding on a roll of one or two without any boni,
this value could be set to 18, and be floored, thus having a maximum success propability of 19/20.
This also implies a cap on the maximum useful value in any basic stat.
