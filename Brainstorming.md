# Brainstorming

## Ideas

### Classless System
There is no benefit of a priori classes as in *Pathfinder* or *Dungeons and Dragons*.
In fact it only generates more bureaucracy and encumbers the role playing.

E.g.: there is no rational reason, why a warrior should be unable to learn at least simlple heal spells,
or a magician should be unable to use a sword effectively (see Gandalf in J.R.R. Tolkiens *The Lord of the Rings*).
Although *D&D* supports the widening of classes, this only proves a class system unnecessary.

Interestingly, cutting out a priori classes does not remove them in RP;
one can claim himself to be a Paladin by learning stuff, paladins do, and by acting like one.

### Focus on Basic Character Values
The should be as few *idirect* characters stats as possible;
i.e., no additional values, which are calculated from the characters base values,
such as *attack power* which may be calculated from *streng* or *agility*.

This removes the necessity of propagating changes through the character sheet.

### Possible Basic Character Values
#### Body
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Strength  | Plain muscle strength; affects any acts of force.|
| Constitution | Affects the characters health, as well as how long and how often the character can maintain any act of body.|
| Toughness | Affects the effect of acts of force against the character. |
| Dexterity | Affects the characters gross motor skills. |
| Reflex | Affects, how fast the character cat react to its environment. |
| Accuracy | Affects the characters fine motor skills. |
| Swiftness | Affects the characters movement speed. |

#### Mind

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Reason | Affects the characters ability of logical reasoning. |
| Willpower | Affects the characters mental health, as well as how long and how often the character can maintain any act of mind. |
| Resolve | Affects the effect of mental force against the character. |
| Sharpness | Affects, how fast a character can think.| 
| Wisdom | Represents the factual knowledge a character has aquired; i.e., lore, history, scientific facts,.... |
| Charisma | Affects the effect of the character on other characters. |
| Eloquence | Affects, how well the character can interact with other characters. |

### More Basic Character Values
To prevent the loss of depth, there could be more basic character values.
This could be achieved by *splitting* some values such as *Body* into
more distinct ones such as *Strenght*, *Reaction*, *Accuracy*, ...,
instead of calculating the disticter ones from the more basic ones.

### Levelless System
Instead of leveling a character as in any *D&D* like system,
not the character, but the character values itself could gain EP and levels,
as it is done in *The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion*.
Thus, a successful roll on a value could always yield some EP.
For combined check rolls, the amount of EP may be spread evenly among the involved character stats.

### Prefered Basic Values
Instead of having classes, one may choose a set of basic values,
which gain more experience.
E.g.: if someone wants to play a fighter character, he may choose strengt as a *prefered character value*
and may thus gain 1.5 or 2 times the experience in this base value.

### Combined Check Rolls
Check rolls could be combined by adding all values together and rolling on the average of them:
e.g.: if someone wants to tell a lie, the values of *intelligence* and *charisma* are added and then divided by two;
then one has to roll below this value to succeed.

### Reversed Exponential Propotionality between a Basic Value and the Roll Value
To get the value for check rolls from a basic value,
a reversed exponential function could be used.
Such a function grows fast in the lower part of its domain and slows down the higher the input values get,
finally converging to a fixed value.

Given a basic roll success propability of 1/10, thus succeeding on a roll of one or two without any boni,
this value could be set to 18, and be floored, thus having a maximum success propability of 19/20.
This also implies a cap on the maximum useful value in any basic stat.

### Concerning Spells and Skills
Due to the classlessness, spells and skills could be leared visiting trainers,
paying them money according to the caracters basic values.
Also, as in *Diablo*, books could be aquired to teach the spell to the owner.
Anyway, there should be requirements of basic stats to learn a spell,
to prevent learning an overpowered spell at low level.

### *Uses per Day* sucks
Have a *Mana* system. 
Also, the simulation of exhaustion by using a spell or skill is much more reasonable,
than just limiting the use of it to a arbitrary number per Day or Rest.

### Action Point System
Every action in combat costs *action points*.
Moves may cost action points depending on the characters speed, however it is represented.

### Competetive Rolls
The bonus of the *defender* is used as a malus to the *attacker*.
